# malware-traffic

A malware traffic analysis platform to detect and explain network traffic anomaly

## Setup

The scripts are written in Python. The first step is to install the requirements with pip:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

We also wrote a C++ library (modified an already existed one to be precise) to speed up some custom function computations. The consequence is that you need to install it manually.
The library is in `Experiments/exp16_visualisation/pylcs` or at https://github.com/nima3333/pylcs.
You can just install by typing: ``python3 setup.py install``.

## Use

The repository contains all the code in the `Experiments` directory. Each experiment is a step we took to develop the project.
Curently, only [exp15_frida_apis](Experiments/exp15_frida_apis/readme.md) and [exp16_visualisation](Experiments/exp16_visualisation/readme.md)are used. The first one is the set of scripts needed to record the malware activity on our virtual machine in order to build our dataset.
The second one is the set of scripts used to analyze the dataset. 
You can find more relevent readme in both previously mentioned directories.
