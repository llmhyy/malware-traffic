1. keep extending the visualized segmentation to more stages of trickbot and more malware samples like trickbot
-Record "full" trickbot operation DONE
-Verify segmentation DONE
-Implement non-supported TLS version stub DONE
-Record this trickbot 1-2 other times
-Do a seq diagram

2. leave a tutorial of decrypt ip list and complement a sequence diagram for the trickbot traffic
-Done

3. think aboutt he real-world application, narrow down the malware traffic from a mixed large traffic file.
-Have to think about it
some kind of recording computer with a ringing recording ?
