# Readme: traffic recording

The directory `exp15_frida_apis` contains all the code related to the recording of the network dataset.

## Usage

Put the ```scripts```directory in the desktop of the Windows VM. It is necessary to install Python and some requirements by typing:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Then, simply launch ``activate.bat``. The results will be automatically saved in the ``exp`` directory after the analysis time (1h by default).
The folder generated this way is the one whose path must be specified for the analysis in ``exp16_visualisation``.
